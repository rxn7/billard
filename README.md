# Billiards
This is a game of billiards (pool) written in C++ using SFML for rendering and event handling and GLM for quaternion/matrix maths.

# Build dependencies
- SFML (2.5)
- GLM
- ImGUI
- ImGUI-SFML
- glslang (to validate the shaders during build)

# Build
If you're on Linux (tested only on arch) just make sure you have the dependencies installed and run ```make```.
The makefile validates the shaders, compiles the shaders, copies the assets, and compiles the executable.

# Devlogs
I document the progress on my youtube channel: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVsn5gXfgBQcwPg6fdQcR0NCpo5vr9-6O
